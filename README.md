# Hi, I'm Jason :no_mouth:

### Who I am

I'm a fullstack PHP developer, living in Antwerp, Belgium, and this is my Github.  After high school I eventually found my way into accounting, doing that for about 12 years for a number of smaller and larger companies in Antwerp.

In 2016 I decided to switch careers and do something that was genuinly interesting and challenging to me, so I started studying programming.  I'm a junior at the moment, focusing a a limited number of technologies in order to get a grasp on all aspects of them.

### What I do
Well... Programming, of course.  Whaddya think I'm doing here?  Selling banana's?!

### The technologies I'm comfortable working with are (and will expand in time):

**Languages**
- PHP
- JavaScript


**Other**
- Symfony
- WordPress & WooCommerce customization
- API integration
- HTML, CSS, and jQuery
- MySQL

### What I've made

You'll find a few basic projects here, probably centered around food, working out, and other things that interest me, and where I'm using technology to automate the boring stuff, give me an edge, or just try something new...

At the moment I'm hosting some of them on Firebase or Heroku, and some on a Rapsberry Pi here at home (which explains the fact that some projects have regular downtime - the Pi is probably just unplugged)

### Where you can see it all (with fancy styling)

My portfolio page is [jasongoossens.be](https://jasongoossens.be).  It has:
- :book: a short description of my career
- :page_facing_up: my CV
- :wrench: link to a couple of projects
- :envelope: how to contact me

### What I'm doing/planning to do
- make my portfolio site impress (cause it's a bit bland right now...)
- add interesting (and worthwhile) projects (anyone can make and upload a tutorial)
- expand my knowledge of Symfony
